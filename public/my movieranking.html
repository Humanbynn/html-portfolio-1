    <h3>JUNG_E</h3>
</p>
<P>I'll recommend this anytime and anyday.<br />
    Its about a war hero whose brain was copied and the project to create a war robot with her brain sequence was initiated.<br >
    There were series of failure which changed the course of plan until the intervention of someone (i bet you want to find out who that is by yourself)

<h3>Avatar 1 & 2</h3>
<p>No, this is not that cartoon Avatar.<br>
    This involves humans and is a good movie to watch. My babe made me see it,you should too.

</p>
<h3>Pursuit of 'Happyness'</h3>
<p>
    This is a really emotional movie.<br >
    Will Smith stars as the protagonist who passes through hell in order to become successful, its a nice watch.
</p>
<h3>42</h3>
<p>
    This is quite emotional too.<br >
    This ia an american baseball setting where a black man must succeed against all odds in a prrdominant racist environment. Will he break?
