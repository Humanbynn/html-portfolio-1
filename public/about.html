<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ekson Emmanuel Ayomide, currently an undergraduate of Electrical/Electronics Engineering in Olusegun Agagu University of science and Technology, Okitipupa (OAUSTECH), previously known as OSUSTECH.<br>
  I'm in my twenties, i actually look younger than my age lol
</p>

<p>I have a great ambition and my goals are a lot. I've been interested in Tech since i was a child but didn't have the resources to go into it until now, maybe i just didn't have the courage to tell my nigerian parents that i wanted to be an hacker.<br>
  Growing up watching hollywood movies always made me fantasize about becoming an hacker with my black clothes and black powerbike lol. i didn't even know there was something like a white hat or black hat hacker as at that time.
</p>

<p>And here i am now, studying an engineering course in the university but still with an interest in Tech.<br> Maybe i'll go ahead and become an hacker someday, I don't know!<br> I'm presently pursuing a career in Web Development and i'm determined to give it all i've got.<br> Walk with me, You're a part of my success journey.</p>
